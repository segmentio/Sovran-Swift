# Sovran-Swift
Small, Efficient, Easy.  State Management for Swift.

Sovran's goal is to be minimal, efficient, easy to implement and to make debugging state changes effortless.

While it is a rather opinionated library, we hope that you'll find said opinions to be with good reason.  While it 
is somewhat similar to things like Redux and Flux there are some natural differences when applied to Swift.

### We don't like large state structures

Large state structures just aren't terribly useful.  Subscribers typically only care about a small subset of the 
data contained within.  We have opted to allow multiple state structures to be supplied and work in unison.
This has the benefit of subscribers to be given *just* the parts of the state that they are interested in.  It's highly
recommended that state structures only contain properties that relate to one another in some obvious way.

By using structs to define state objects, we benefit from the natural copy mechanism within Swift to make sure
no direct access to state is given to subscribers.

### We don't like artificial constraints

We've been very careful to not dictate how you write your code.  If you want one state structure to subscribe to
another unrelated state, we assume you have a good reason.   If you want a single giant state structure, while it's
not our first choice of solutions, you can do that if you need to.  If you need to be unconventional, do it.  Everything
has a time and place.

### Types should be explicit, but inferred where possible

You'll notice that when using Sovran, it's actually the closure input that defines the type of state that a given 
subscription is intended to work against.  This allows us to avoid having developers supply the type twice.

Example:
```swift
store.subscribe(self) { (state: MyState) in
    // MyState was updated, react to it in some way.
    print(state)
}
```
In the example above, `MyState` is defining the generic type needed by the subscribe call.

### We want it to be *very* debuggable

It is very common for bugs to occur in code.  This library is architected such that most anywhere within the 
library as well as your own code, the stack trace shows the exact point a state change was initiated and all
points in between.  We didn't want to replicate the frustration that's common in other similar systems, such
as NotificationCenter, where hours are spent trying to figure out where/why a notification was sent so that a
bug can be addressed.

## Contributing


- Please see our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- To submit a bug report or feature request, [file an issue here](issues).
- To develop on `Sovran` or propose changes, see [our contributors documentation](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Why not Combine?

- Combine is closed-source and only available on Apple platforms.
- Combine uses compiler-magic to do its job.
- We need state wherever Swift can be used (Android, Linux, etc)
- Combine is designed around and for Apple's other tools, SwiftUI, etc.
